|Quantity to ship| The number of items has been ordered but not been shipped yet. This number will be returned to Avail Qty & Qty in Warehouse(s) if the shipment is cancelled|
|Shelf Location| Insert the detailed area in the shelf where the product is located. This is how you can support your staff in finding the product efficiently in the physical warehouse|

|Stock Adjustment History | Stock Adjustment History records all inventory corrections/ updates when there are some differences between stock levels of physical and virtual warehouses|
| Stocktaking| Stocktaking is performed to double-check and prevent any mismatch between the recorded product quantities and the actual inventory in your physical warehouses. The process includes 5 stages containing stock counting and admin’s approval before actually updating the Qty in the system|
|Stocktaking History| Stocktaking History records all stocktaking acts and their process status| 
|Stock Movement History|Stock Movements are records of inward &outward stock transfers of a warehouse| 
|Supply Needs|Supply Need is the system’s prediction about how many inventory items you need for each product within a future period. The system will calculate this number based on your sales history in the corresponding period in the past| 
|Available Date| Based on the sales history in the chosen sales period, the system will estimate the day which a product is sold out and need to be restocked| 
|Low-stock Threshold Type|To get notification about the out-of-stock product, you will have to define how the system process. There are 2 methods: by Available Days or by Available Quantity| 
|Threshold (days)| If you insert 3 in this field, the low stock notification will appear 3 days before the product is out of stock. The  sold out day is estimated based on sales history of the chosen sales period|
|Sales Period (days)|If you insert 30 in this field, the threshold days will be estimated based on sales history in 30 days up to now|
|Threshold (quantity)|If you insert 5 in this field, the low stock notification will appear when there are only 5 items of the product in stock|

## How to configure 

Go to **Settings** and you are able to configure the Instock Management module as below:

![configure instock management module](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image001.png)

1. **Link stocks in Warehouse to Front Store View**: The Instock Management module allows synchronization between the warehouse and its Magento front store. This means when you edit information or product quantity of a warehouse, this information will automatically be updated in that warehouse’s front store and visible to customers.
After enabling this setting, you can link the warehouse to one or multiple store view in **Warehouses > General Information > Magento Store View**

![choose front store view to link warehouse to](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image001-1.png)

2. **Adjust Stock by entering the change qty**: 
- If this feature is enabled, when adjusting stock, you can enter the difference quantity and the system will calculate the final balance in warehouse.
- If this feature is disabled, you need to enter the exact quantity of stock in warehouse and the system will recognize this figure as the latest available quantity of product. 


----------

## How to Use

### Stock Listing

After installation, the system will automatically provide a Primary Warehouse. This Primary Warehouse cannot be deleted but can only be edited. All the existing products will be automatically synced from your website to this warehouse before you can assign to another warehouse. 

This function consists of 3 tabs to help you manage your inventory successfully:

 - **Stock in Warehouse**: provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses or in a specific warehouse
 - **Non-warehouse Products**: lists out a newly-created product which has not been assigned to any warehouse
 - **Warehouses**: allows you to view and edit details of your warehouses

#### Stock in Warehouse

This tab provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses. Here you can view stock SKU, Name, Price, Qty in Warehouse(s), Qty to Ship, Available Qty, Products in Warehouse(s), Stock Movement and Product Status. 

The module provides an in-depth control over your **composite products** (configurable, bundle and grouped products).  You can see 3 quantity types of each variation or component of the composite product in a specific warehouse. 

For example, if you have a configurable product whose root SKU is Pwt007, you can see the quantities of each available size. If you sell products which often have different sizes and colors like clothing, this is an efficient way to control your inventory. 

![control configurable product with variable sizes](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image002.png)

Note that there are 3 types of quantity shown:

 - **Qty in Warehouse(s)**: total amount of products in physical warehouses;
 - **Qty to ship**: the number of products which has been ordered and is ready to be shipped;
 - **Available Qty**: the amount of products left in the virtual catalog which is available to sell.
 
Note that **Qty in Warehouse(s) = Qty to Ship + Available Qty**

You can select a warehouse in the drop-down list and the stock details in that particular warehouse will be displayed. 

![select a warehouse](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image003.png)

Update the total quantity and Shelf Location easily on the Inventory grid in only 4 steps:

 - **Step 1**: Select the product(s);
 - **Step 2**: Input the new Qty in Warehouse(s) 
 - **Step 3**: Add Shelf Location (optional);
 - **Step 4**: Click “**Update Stock**”.

![change stock quantity](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image004.png)

**Shelf Allocation** is a useful information to find the product in the physical stock quickly, especially in fulfilling customer’s order.

#### Non-warehouse Products

When a product is newly-created and has not been assigned to any warehouse yet, it will automatically be allocated in this Non-warehouse list. 

![transfer non-warehouse product to a warehouse](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image007.png)

1. Select the product(s);
2. Choose **Add to Warehouse** from the drop-down list; select the destination warehouse and click **Submit**.

#### Warehouses

The **Warehouses** page displays each warehouse’s details such as its ID, name, total SKUs and total product quantities in each warehouse, contact email/ tel./ address. 

Our Inventory Management function allows synchronization between the warehouse and its Magento front store. This means when you edit information or product quantity of a warehouse, this information will automatically be updated in that warehouse’s front store and visible to customers. You can enable this function in **Settings** as mentioned in the **How to Configure** section above.

![Warehouses page](./image_IM%20Rebuilt/image008.png)
