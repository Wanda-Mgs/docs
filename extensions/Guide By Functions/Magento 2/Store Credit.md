### How Customer uses Store Credit

#### How Customers buy Credit Product

After customers log in to your website, they can access the **Store Credit Products** page in two ways:

- **Option 1**:

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image634.png?raw=true)

On the top navigation bar, click to **Buy Store Credit**

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image635.png?raw=true)

After that, the **Store Credit** page will be shown as above.

As you can see, this page lists all **Credit Products** of your website. There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, the range of values and drop-down values. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image636.png?raw=true)

***(1)	Fixed Value:*** These credit products have a fixed value. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image637.png?raw=true)

***(2)	Drop-down Values***: With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image638.png?raw=true)

***(3)	The range of Values***: With this type, customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in the backend. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image639.png?raw=true)

After selecting credit products they like, customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.

When the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the customer’s credit balance.

Customers can also send Credits to their friends by doing the following steps: 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image640.png?raw=true)

(1)	Tick **Send credit to friend** checkbox 

(2)	Enter the name of the recipient 

(3)	Enter the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address

(4)	Enter the message that recipient will receive.

- **Option 2**:

*Path:* **My Dashboard** page **> My Credit** tab 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image641.png?raw=true)

To buy credit product, click on the **My Credit** on the left navigation of the **Account Dashboard** page.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image642.png?raw=true)

In this second way, customers will be navigated to the **My Credit** page on which they just need to click on the **Buy store credit** button. Then, the Credit Products page will be displayed and customers can continue buying credit as mentioned steps in option 1 above. 

When the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image643.png?raw=true)

**Case 1**: if the recipient does not have an account in the system, an email as above will be sent. 

**Case 2**: if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient’s credit balance.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image644.png?raw=true)

In both cases, the sender always gets email notifications as above.

#### How to manage Credit on My Credit page

- *Path:* **My Dashboard** page **> My Credit** tab 
**a.	Manage Credit Balance**

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image645.png?raw=true)

On the **My Credit** page, customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.

In the section **Transaction History**, our module shows customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including ***date, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction** and ***credit balance.***

**b.	Send Credit to Friends**

- *Path:* **My Dashboard** page **> My Credit** tab **> Send Credit** tab

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image646.png?raw=true)

First, customers should click on the **Send Credit** tab on the left navigation to go to the **Send Credit to Friends** page as above. 

This page has 2 parts including ***Send Credit to Friends*** and ***Credit Code List.***

- ***Send Credit to Friends***: allows customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information

- ***Credit Code List***: shows all information about the credit codes that customers sent to their friends including ***code, recipient’s email, amount, sent date*** and ***status of code***. Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When customers click on, they will be shown clearly.

Please note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.

**Case 1**: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image647.png?raw=true)

(1)	Enter recipient’s email

(2)	Add an amount that customers want to send to their friends.

(3)	Write a message to the recipient. 

(4)	Click on Send button

Notice that after entering recipient’s email, our module will check that email address and show a notification to customers.

- **If the recipient’s email has not been registered on the website:**

In this case, our module will show a notification for the customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. After that, the sender’s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient’s email address.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image648.png?raw=true)

As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.

At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the **Credit Code List** section as below.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image649.png?raw=true)

In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the **Cancel** link in the **Action** column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code anymore.

Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated, and the **Cancel** link will be disabled. Please refer to the section **Redeem Credit** for more information. 

Customers can also check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the **Transaction History** section.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image650.png?raw=true)

- **If the recipient’s email has been registered on the website:**

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image651.png?raw=true)

If the recipient’s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email. 

Customers can check their current balances and transactions in the **Transaction History** section. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image652.png?raw=true)

At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image653.png?raw=true)

- **Case 2**: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image654.png?raw=true)

If you configure that customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the **Send** button, they will receive an email as above.

At the same time, they will be navigated to the **Verify** page.

On this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the **Credit Code List,** that code is put under the “**Awaiting verification**” status with a **Verify** link. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image655.png?raw=true)

To verify, customers can:

(1)	 Enter the verification code they received in their emails 

(2)	Click on the **Submit Code** button.

After customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.

**c.	Redeem Credit**

- *Path:* **My Dashboard** page **> My Credit** tab **> Redeem Credit** tab

To go to the **Redeem Credit** page, customers can click on the **Redeem Credit** tab on the left navigation.

On this page, customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance as following steps:

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image656.png?raw=true)

(1)	Enter the code in the text field 

(2)	Clicking on the **Redeem** button.

Another way is just to click on the link in the email.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image657.png?raw=true)

#### How to check out by Credit 

Customers can use credit to check out on both **Shopping Cart** and **Checkout** page. 

On the **Shopping Cart** page, our module will add **Apply Credit Discount** block for customers to use their credit balances at checkout. 

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image658.png?raw=true)
 
To use a credit amount, customers can:

(1)	Enter that number in the field 

(2)	Click on the **Apply** button and then our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of the order.

Please note that customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the **Customer Credit** block as below.

![store credit](./SC%20Image/image659.png?raw=true)
  
On the **Checkout** page, in the **Payment Information** tab, apply credit discount the same as in the **Shopping Cart** page.
