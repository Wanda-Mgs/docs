# STORE PICKUP - USER GUIDE FOR MAGENTO 2

**Version 1.2.0**
 


--------------------------

## Introduction

According to ComScore, 61% of shoppers would rather use free in-store pickup than pay for shipping. Thus, 72% of retailers start allowing Customers to purchase online before coming to a store and receive purchased products. If there is a chain of stores available, undoubtedly Customers will choose the nearest one as well as an appropriate time to arrive. How can the store-owner make that happen? The answer is Magento 2 Store Pickup extension – the most professional Magento shipping extension, which allows setting up multiple Magento stores, showing addresses and opening time of each store for the Customers’ convenience.

[Magento Store Pickup](https://www.magestore.com/store-locator-pickup) is one module in our [Omnichannel solution](https://www.magestore.com/omnichannel-retail) for Magento retailers.

## HOW TO CONFIGURE

You have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.

***Tips*:*** For quick instructions on where to set up each function and how to get Google Map API Key, you can go to: **Store Pickup > Settings > Service API** 

Click on the link for Google Map API Key Registration Guide

![Store pickup configure](./Store%20Pickup%20Image/image056.png?raw=true)

***Update*:*** One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.

This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.

However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.

### Manage Store

The **Manage Store** grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status. To add new stores, you can add them manually and import from CSV files.
