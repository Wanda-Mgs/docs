##  How to Prepare and Ship Items for Sales Order


### Drop-ship

**“Drop-shipping (Drop-ship)** is a term to describe the retailer does not keeping goods in stock, but instead transferring sales orders and shipment details to the wholesaler/ supplier, who then ships the goods directly to the customer.”

With Dropship module, you will act as the retailer, passing the order information onto your supplier for shipping. As items on drop-ship are not passed through your hands, they don’t affect to the Qty. and inventory movements in your warehouses.


### Drop-ship Process

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to handle a sales order that will be drop shipped to a customer. If you do not have enough in stock to complete the sales order, then a drop-ship request should be made and sent to the suppliers. The process contains only 3 simple steps:

-	Admin sends drop-ship request to the supplier
-	The supplier ships items to customers and confirm the shipped Qty after shipping
-	Admin creates/cancels shipment

**Step 1:** Admin sends drop-ship request to the supplier
When fulfilling an order in backend (with ***Order Fulfillment module for Magento 2***), in the **Prepare Fulfil** step, you can choose **Request Dropship** option. Select **Fulfill** button on the right of the order you want to request drop-ship for.

The drop-down list in the **Shipping Channel** field includes drop-ship. Select **Request Dropship**, choose **Add Products to Request** then it will show all available suppliers that provide corresponding products. You can choose among these suppliers as preferred.

After that, click on the **Add Selected Product(s to Request** and **Save** button to send drop-ship requests to the suppliers chosen.

The drop-ship request is saved in **Dropship Request**. The status of this dropshipment in backend is **Pending**.

**Step 2:** The supplier ships items to customers and confirm the shipped Qty after shipping.

Each supplier selected will receive a notification email about the drop-ship request as below:

As being instructed in the email, the supplier follows the login link to access the **Supplier Manager** page and then fills in the Qty. that he can ship.

**Note:** When adding/ editing a supplier (in ***Purchase Management module for Magento 2***), the **Password Management** section will be shown. You can set password and email it to the supplier. The email will be shown as below:

The supplier can use his email address and password to log in on the **Supplier** page and create drop-ship.  The supplier need to enter the carrier information and shipped Qty to create shipment. After a supplier create shipment, you will receive a notification email as below:

**Step 3:** Admin creates/cancels shipment.

If the supplier refuses to create shipment, you need to create shipment by yourself. Go to **Dropship Request** section and find the order you want to work with. Choose **Create Shipment** to complete this order or **Back to Prepare Fulfill** to cancel/request dropship from other suppliers.

Notification email when the storeowner cancel the dropship request:
