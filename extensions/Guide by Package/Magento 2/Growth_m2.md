### Store Pickup

You have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.

***Tips***: For quick instructions on where to set up each function and how to get Google Map API Key, you can go to: **Store Pickup > Settings > Service API**

Click on the link for Google Map API Key Registration Guide

![Store Pickup](./image_growth_m2/image055.png?raw=true)
 
***Update***: **One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that** required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.

This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.

However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.

##### Split & Partial Payment with Web POS 
**a. For Split Payment**

You can allow customers more than 1 method to pay when using Web POS. Particularly, they could pay a part of bill by cash and other part will be paid by credit card. 	

For example: This order values $249 and customer wants to pay $50 in cash. Then you have to enter this number in the field of “Web POS- Cash in” and the remain money will be calculated automatically for you. 

![For Split Payment](./image_growth_m2/image256.png?raw=true)
 
To solve “Remain money”, you can click on **Add Payment** button on the left corner of the screen 

![For Split Payment](./image_growth_m2/image257.png?raw=true)
 
After clicking on **Add Payment**, Customers have those options to pay for the remaining money

For instance, Customer chooses “Web POS – Credit Card” and the system will be displayed like this: 

![For Split Payment](./image_growth_m2/image258.png?raw=true)

And then, please tap on **Place Order** button to complete this order. The process is done. 

**Notes:**
- *Support multiple payment methods for one order*
- *Not require Cash-in method as compulsory*

**b. For Partial Payment**

This function allows customers to pay a part of value first and other parts will be paid later in different interval. Especially when customers want to reserve goods before it’s arrived at store, they could leave a deposit and they will complete the bill after having product in their hand. 

For example, the total value is $249, and customers want to pay $50 first and $199 they will pay later

![For Partial Payment](./image_growth_m2/image259.png?raw=true)
 
1.	Enter 50$ in the field of “Web POS – Cash in”
2.	Tap on **MARK AS PARTIAL**

I will take another example for you like this: 

![For Partial Payment](./image_growth_m2/image261.png?raw=true)
 
This order is remaining $199 that the customer hasn’t paid yet. 

And when he comes back to accomplish this order, staff could tap **Take payment** and choose payment method for customer to pay in the popup as below:

![For Partial Payment](./image_growth_m2/image262.png?raw=true)
 
Staff can keep on adding  more payment methods as they want by clicking on **Add more Payment Method**. By clicking Submit, total paid will be equal to the whole value of order. Process is done.
